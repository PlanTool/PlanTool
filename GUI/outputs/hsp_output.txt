usage: hsp <flags>* [ <algorithm> | -S <schedule> ] <problem.pddl> <domain.pddl>
where <flags> are among:
   -v <level>		Verbose level >= 0 (default is 1).
   -w <weight>		Float to weight the heuristic component of the cost function.
<algorithm> is:
   -a <algorithm>	Either 'bfs' or 'gbfs'.
   -d <direction>	Either 'forward' or 'backward'.
   -h <heuristic>	One of 'h1plus', 'h1max', 'h2plus', 'h2max'.
<schedule> is a colon separated <option> list where each option has
form '[<direction>,<heuristic>,<msecs>]'. The options are performed
sequentially until one finds a plan, or no more options are available
(each option is attempted with the given time constraint).
