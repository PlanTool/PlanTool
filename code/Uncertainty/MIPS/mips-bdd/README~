MIPS-BDD, (c) Stefan Edelkamp, University of Dortmund

Slightly revised competition version 2007

Includes:

- Cost-optimal search for linear metrics with integer coefficients

- PDB optimization with genetic algorithms (not used in the competition)

---

Bidirectional BFS in propositional domains

Grounding input 

./ground <domain-file> <problem-file>

writes domain.pddl problem.pddl and problem.psas

Calling the solver 

./bdd-solver

writes mips-solution and simple-solution 

---

Generic Call

./compile <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl>

Changes in subdir <automata>, where also the solution files are
written

./compile /data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/domain_p02.pddl  /data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/p02.pddlProgram calls ltl2ba in its subdir.

(dots removed by top-level script)

Example

./compile /data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/domain_p02.pddl
/data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/p02.pddl

./compile /data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/domain_p02.pddl  /data/jabbar/domains/pathways/Propositional/p02.pddl

Known problems:

- GAlib and Buddy library changes random seed, to be adapted 

- Growth of BDD-sizes to be adapted to 
exploit different amounts of main memory.

// default for 16 GB exploration

 INITIAL_NODES 32000000
 MAX_INCREASE  128000000

- Growth of BDD-sizes beyond 2GB RAM only possible on 64-bit machines

- Search direction for propositional domains hard-coded, default 
bidirectional search; backward direction problematic in some domains.
