BUILDING THE SYSTEM:

Type "./build". If compilation succeeds, you get an executable called "cpt-1.0"
in the current directory.

RUNNING:

Quick start:

cpt-1.0 -o <operator file> -f <problem file>

Run cpt-1.0 without arguments to get a list of the available options. If
compilation succeeded and the planner doesn't work, you can try to decrease the
values of -s option, which are by default 7 and 11. For example, try:

cpt-1.0 -s 6 10 -o <operator file> -f <problem file>

These values have been choosen for a machine with 512Mb of memory.  If you have
more memory, you can increase them... These values define the size of Claire
memory.
