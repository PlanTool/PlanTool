1. (BM) CPlan has an very compressed encoding thanks to the fact that it's
close to lifted encoding. For exp, instead of use one variable to represent
(A on B), it use one variable (A on) to represent all (A on X), and use B,C ...
as value for that constraint.

2. (BM) One of the difficulty is that in CPlan, every variable has quite
predefined domain size, but we can have very dynamic domain size if convert
from GP to CSP.
