+ When reuse the nogood, the important thing to be taken care of is that the
old goal nodes will have one more value. Therefore, all the nogoods that is
constructed based on the checking out all of the value of those nodes will be
useless, because it won't be able to check out all of new domain (all except
the new NULL value). Currently, I handle it by not remember nogood of maximum size
that involve goal nodes, and when I extend, I add one more item to those nogood.
That item include if the goal in the next level that connect with the old goal
by a NOOP.
+ Note that to follow the above way efficiently, I make use of the fact that
the noop is the first in the list. If use the other implementation, then it
won't work..
