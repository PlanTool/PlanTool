The current code is the latest C/C++ version of AltAlt, for a Lisp version
of the planner please write to XuanLong@asu.edu.
	
AltAlt is a planner that uses fast forward expansion of a planning graph
(based in STAN), and calculates set and distance based heuristics to 
guide state search. The current version of the planner allows you to
use a serial planning graph or a parallel planning graph, and also
integrates action pruning given the heuristic information of the state.

Please acknowledge if you are using this code, and report any possible 
bug you could find. Although the planner has been exhaustively tested we 
are not responsible of any bad functionality.

The code has been built and tested using Linux and UNIX (SunOS) with the
g++ compiler. If you have any problems compiling and using the code please
send us an e-mail.

AltAlt (A Little of This A Little of That) is very easy to use, you only need to 
give as arguments a domain name and a problem name, the syntaxis is as
follows.

altalt domain probname [-w{1...n}  -l{1....n}] [heuristics: HPLUS, HCOMBO, HPART1,
								HPART2, HPART2C, HADJSUM1, HADJSUM2, HADJSUM2M,
								HLEVEL] [-of filename] PACTION NOLEVOFF

Examples:

Default heuristic is: HCOMBO, and WEIGHT:5.
Default planning graph is: NOT SERIAL.
Default graph extends until levels off (Write NOLEVOFF on the command line to disable this option).
Default search does not make action prunning (Write PACTION to activate this option: it turns the planner incomplete!).

altalt domain.pddl bw-large-a.pddl    //Solves the given problem with the Combo heuristics (Default)
						                                      //and W=5  (Default)
altalt domain.pddl bw-large-a.pddl -w 1 HPLUS //Solves the same problems with HPLUS heur.
altalt domain.pddl bw-large-a.pddl -w 1 -l 12 HPART2C  //Expands the graph until level 12 and 
												//solves the problem with Partition 2 sibling heuristic. 
altalt domain.pddl bw-large-a.pddl -w 1 HADJSUM1 -of results.txt //Outputs the results to a file.


We hope you have fun playing with our system, and if possible improving it. For a complete description
