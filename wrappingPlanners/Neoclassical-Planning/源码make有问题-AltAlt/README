The code accompanying this file is a revised version of the current
STAN and TIM versions. We have removed code which is currently under
development. STAN is the competition version extended by addition of
symmetry (see our IJCAI'99 paper), EBL/DDB (see Rao Kambhampati's 
IJCAI'99 paper), bug-fixes and other minor modifications described in
our JAIR paper on STAN (volume 10). 

The TIM version we are releasing is the version described in our 
JAIR paper (volume 9), with minor modifications to refine analysis 
of property sub-spaces and attribute spaces, hence producing a few 
more invariants in some domains. We have not released the generic types
analysis that we have been working on, since this work is still under
development - some preliminary results are available through use of the 
executables to be found on our web-site.

The code is undocumented and largely uncommented, at present. A complete
rewrite of TIM, with extensions to handle richer languages, is currently
underway as a funded grant (PREPLAN) and the source code should be made
available shortly. Source code for STAN will be commented and updated as
time allows. 

Please credit the source of the code if you use it. We will be happy to 
hear from people who make use of this code, with comments, questions or
bugs! 

The code has been built and tested using Linux and UNIX (SunOS) with the
g++ compiler. It makes using the Makefile provided. "make tim" will build
TIM, and "make" or "make stan" will build STAN. Execution of both of these
requires a domain and a problem file to be supplied as command line 
arguments, both in PDDL format. If you have any experiences building it
to run under any other OSs which might be helpful to share, please let us
know.



Note that by releasing this code we imply no warranty as to its reliability
and its use is entirely at your own risk.
